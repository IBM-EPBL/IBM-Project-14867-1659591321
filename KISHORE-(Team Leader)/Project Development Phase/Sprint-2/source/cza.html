<h1 style="text-align:center;">Containment Zone Alerting</h1>
<p style="font-size:30px;">The lockdown, implemented in five phases, worked at the national level, while the classification of red, orange and green districts operated at the state and inter-district levels. Demarcation of containment zones is done within a town, village, or municipal or panchayat area.

Neighbourhoods, colonies, or housing societies where infected people <b style="color:red;">live are sealed, and access is restricted. Containment zones are where the restrictions on movement and interaction are the most severe. In many cities, the entire demarcated area is barricaded and the entry and exit points closed. Only the very basic supplies and services are allowed inside.</b></p>


<h1 style="text-align:center;">Who defines the containment zones?</h1>

<p style="font-size:30px;">It is the district, town or panchayat authorities that decide which areas have to be marked as containment zones, how large they would be, and what kind of restrictions would apply. The rules for the national lockdown, for example, were set by the central government, while the state governments decided what restrictions to impose on districts.

The district administration, municipal corporation or panchayat bodies <b style="color:green;"> exercise a great deal of discretion in demarcation of containment zones. The definition and time period vary, and are continuously reviewed and updated.</b></p>

<p style="font-size:30px;"><b style="font-size:30px;">KERALA:</b> If people in home quarantine test positive, or if someone without a known source of infection tests positive, their residential locality and place of work are declared containment zones.
